# Microsoft Azure Global Bootcamp Perth 2015

This repository contains the collateral for the "Continuous Delivery build pipeline using VSTS and Azure PaaS" workshop by Matt Davies and Rob Moore at the [2016 Perth Azure Global Bootcamp](http://www.meetup.com/Perth-Cloud/events/228448853/).

This workshop allows attendees to see the power of both VSTS and Azure PaaS to quickly create a professional build pipeline with a test and production environment from nothing within an hour without having to spin up any Virtual Machines. Attendees will create an environment and web application all specified in source control and all deployments (including infrastructure in Azure and the app itself) will be deployed to both test and production in an automated fashion by the end of the workshop.
